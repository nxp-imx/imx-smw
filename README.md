# Security Middleware Project

This git contains source code (C standard) for the NXP Security Middleware library.

The NXP Security Middleware Library is a software library exposing a set of
unify APIs to execute operations on i.MX Secure Subsystems. The library
intends to be a "bridge" or "wrapper" formatting operation's parameters
function of the Secure Subsystem used.

The objectives of this library are:
- Exposing the same set of APIs regardless the secure operation.
- Making target Secure Subsystems configurable by using a configuration file. This configuration is text buffer loaded at runtime and describing operations versus Secure Subsystems.
- Offering the possibility to use a Secure Subsystem transparently by defining a "default" Secure Subsystem per operation in the configuration file.
- Allowing to use a particular (not default one) Secure Subsystem for each operation.
- Being OS' agnostic. The final target library include a specific OS Abstraction Layer to access non-standard C library system resources.
- Supporting multiple applications and threads.
